## 50.039 Deep Learning Small Project

As part of our 50.039 Deep Learning Small Project, we are tasked to design a deep learning model, whose task is to assist with the
diagnosis of pneumonia, for COVID and non-COVID cases, by using X-ray images of patients.

We implemented two model architectures. This first is a multi-class classifier architecture in the multiclass_small_project_dataset_dataloader.ipynb file while the second consists of two stacked binary classifiers implemented in the binary_small_project_dataset_dataloader.ipynb file.

### Re-train model from scratch

To re-train the whole model from scratch for the multi-class classifier, run all the cells in the multiclass_small_project_dataset_dataloader.ipynb file.

To re-train the whole model from scratch for the two stacked binary classifiers, run all the cells in the binary_small_project_dataset_dataloader.ipynb file.

### Recreate exact trained model
